# What is TAMU Guessr?
TAMU Guessr is a geography based app that has the user guess what location they are in with a google street view of the location on the Texas A&M university. It is heavily inspired on the game **[GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/)** which 
has the exact same premise, but everywhere on the planet. 

We chose to make TAMU Guessr because we really enjoyed playing GeoGuessr and thought it would be both a cool and educational project to make that would appeal to Texas A&M students. 

# How did we make it?
A bulk of the development was done over the course of 24 hours at the HowdyHack hackathon hosted by TAMU Hack by our team: **[Axel](https://github.com/itsoporo)** , **[Hezekiah](https://github.com/Hezxkiah)** and myself. It is made using the NextJS framework with react and tailwind CSS. The Game functionality is primarily done through Javascript embedded into the website. The map functionality is implimented through the Google maps Javascript API which allows us to both display street view as well as the imbedded map and interact with said map.

## What's next?


While all core features are completed, we still plan to slowly work on it and make it into somthing truly special. 
Heres what we plan to add:

### Near Future
- External image storage (Vercel won't store all our images locally so theres some GUI bugs)
- Google Pano ID support so we can use specific user uploaded 3D street view data
- Adjustment to the score curve so guesses within around 10m recieve full points

### Long Term
- User created accounts
- Highscores
- Multiplayer
